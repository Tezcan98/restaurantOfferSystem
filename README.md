# Get Started

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.\
In this project I have develop a services that include almost 100k restaurants fro [TripAdvisor Restaurants Info for 31 Euro-Cities](https://www.kaggle.com/damienbeneschi/krakow-ta-restaurans-data-raw) \
This web application makes it easy to find restaurants and classify your feedback as positive or negative and shift the position to the lower or higher ranks.

Walkthroughs in the development process
  - Trimmed and filtering some columns to use the data needed from csv
  - Create Postgre Database and upload edited data
  - Design Html&Css template and connect with Django
  - [Create a Sentiment Analyzer with Text Classification in python](https://itnext.io/how-to-create-a-sentiment-analyzer-with-text-classification-python-ai-f3a5d10922c5)
  - Finally some Javascript codes
  
It's Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines lecture's task so just work in localhost.
